# jwt-auth

The primary emphasis of this project is on the backend, particularly on token-based authentication. 
On the frontend, I've made straightforward login and signup pages. After a successful login or signup, users are directed to a landing page. 
This streamlined approach ensures that the complexities of secure authentication remain behind the scenes, providing users with a seamless and intuitive experience.
