# Auth_vjezba Frontend README

## Overview:

The primary emphasis of this project is on the backend, particularly on token-based authentication. On the frontend, I've made straightforward login and signup pages using react.js and tailiwnd. After a successful login or signup, users are directed to a landing page. This streamlined approach ensures that the complexities of secure authentication remain behind the scenes, providing users with a seamless and intuitive experience.

## Features:

1. **Sign Up Page**:
    - Allows new users to register by providing their details.
    - Displays feedback if the username or email is already taken.
    - Redirects to the login page upon successful registration.

2. **Login Page**:
    - Lets users log in using their username and password.
    - Displays an error message for invalid credentials.
    - Redirects to the landing page upon successful login.

3. **Landing Page**:
    - Greets the user with a "Welcome {username}" message.
    - Provides a link to the developer's GitHub profile.

## Usage:

1. **To Sign Up**:
    - Navigate to the Sign Up page.
    - Fill in the required fields such as username, email, and password.
    - Click on the 'Sign Up' button. If the registration is successful, you will be redirected to the login page. Otherwise, relevant error messages will be shown.

2. **To Log In**:
    - Go to the Login page.
    - Enter your username and password.
    - Click on the 'Log In' button. If the credentials are correct, you will be redirected to the landing page.

3. **Landing Page**:
    - Once logged in, you'll see a personalized greeting.
